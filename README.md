# ChatGPT Plugin - Solo RPG

This is a ChatGPT plug-in that allows users to play Solo RPG games! There are pre-loaded scenarios that can be accessed and played through. 

The main idea behind all this is to give the users full freedom and control over the scenarios that are presented. I plan on expanding this by allowing people to add their own custom scenarios, making specific user accounts to access their scenarios, making a forum/page where people can vote on what they like the best and favorite certain ones in their account, and the ability to share the outcome of their Solo RPG with their friends! 

This is tackling the game aspect that comes with ChatGPT and introducting more creativity to the users.
